Store:

Client cannot connect or send data to all R Dstores
o No further action, the state of the file in the index will remain “store in
progress”; future rebalances will try to sort things out by ensuring the file is
replicated to R Dstores
• If the Controller does not receive all the acks (e.g., because the timeout expires),
the STORE_COMPLETE message should not be sent to the Client, and filename
should be removed from the index


Load:

don't know if need to add file doesn't exist and not enough dstores error handling to reload too

• If Dstore does not have the requested file
o Simply close the socket with the Client
Need to add this to dstores

Very importantly need dstores to be able to serve many clients at once


Remove:

from index all dstore ports are removed if remove was successful but if not none are removed,
this is bad because some actually did remove it so is there was a load then the client would be
asking to load from a dstore that doesn't have it. so need to fix, currently trying to do it gives
concurrent modification exception.

• Controller cannot connect to some Dstore, or does not receive all the ACKs within
the timeout
o No further action, the state of the file in the index will remain "remove in
progress"; future rebalances will try to sort things out by ensuring that no
Dstore stores that file

List:

currently only showing files that have status "store complete". need to check this is correct,
i assume it is.
